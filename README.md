# Artificial_Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence Projects for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course

The following projects were done in Python. The first project was implemented on a simulation of an environment containing various mazes chosen at random and the remaining four projects were implemented on a simulation of the Pacman game.

AI_Challenge1: Contains the following:
  Implementation of the AI of a Simple Reflex Agent, a Model-Based Reflex Agent and a
  Utility-based Agent. The goal of these agents will be to clean as much dust as
  possible within a limited time.

  Simple Reflex Agent: The simple reflex agent is not allowed to store any data, it may only use the current data from its sensors.

  Model-Based Agent:  The model-based agent should maintain a state that contains
                      the current knowledge the agent has about its surroundings and update this state according to new sensor information and its world-model.

  Utility Based Agent: A utility based agent will try to balance the objective of cleaning as much dust as possible with the objective of conserving as much energy as possible.

AI_Challenge2:  Contains the implementation of the search algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search and uniform-cost search to help Pacman clear-out all the food in the maze.
 
AI_Challenge3:  Contains the implementation of A* and various heuristics to increase the performance of the agent.
 
AI_Challenge4:  Contains the agents for the classic version of Pac-Man, including ghosts. It also contains the implementation of minimax with alpha-beta
                pruning and evaluation function design.
 
AI_Challenge5:  Contains the  Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. It also contains advancement of the agent from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.

AI_final_project: Contains implementation of an artificial intelligence agent in Arcade Learning Environment to play Freeway. Built a reinforcement learning agent in C++ which learns how to play the game and scores the maximum as the game goes on for several times.
